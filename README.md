# Gas Leakage Detector Robot
The theme is modelled based on a factory like scenario consisting of four pipeline areas. The pivotal task of the theme is for an autonomous robot to meticulously detect and stop the leakage of the gas in this factory. The robot has to navigate through the entire factory. While doing so, it has to detect and stop all the leaking gases, without damaging the arena. The gas leakage has been replaced by different color LEDs and is sensed with the help of a color sensor. The valve is closed by dropping a magnet in the valves which will trigger a set of reed switches to close the gas leakage.
